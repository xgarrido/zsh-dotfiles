* Introduction
This =zsh= plugin manages my personal dotfiles.

The latest version is at http://github.com/xgarrido/zsh-dotfiles.

* Installation
You will need to install first the [[https://github.com/xgarrido/zsh-pkgtools][=pkgtools=]] plugin which is a small zsh library providing useful
function such as colored text...

There are different way to install this plugin :
** In your =~/.zshrc=
1) Download the script or clone this repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     git clone git://github.com/xgarrido/zsh-dotfiles.git
   #+END_SRC

2) Source this script *at the end* of =~/.zshrc=:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     source /path/to/zsh-dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles.plugin.zsh
   #+END_SRC

3) Source =~/.zshrc= to take changes into account:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     source ~/.zshrc
   #+END_SRC

** With [[https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen][antigen]] (recommended way)
Add the following line into your =~/.zshrc= file:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  antigen bundle xgarrido/zsh-dotfiles
#+END_SRC

* Inside =dotfiles=

The dotfiles are stored within the =dotfiles= directory and include (non exhaustive list)
