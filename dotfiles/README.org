* Description
These are my personal dotfiles, which I manage with the help of git. This is the base dotfiles
repository which contains what I want to have available in a basic shell environment.

* What is included

The dotfiles are stored within the =dotfiles= directory and include (non exhaustive list)

** Shell environment

  and loading different zsh plugins
- [[file:bashrc][bashrc]] :: bash (not used anymore)
- [[file:profiles][profiles]] :: defines =PATH= variable and other environment variables
- [[file:toprc][toprc]] :: fancy colors for =top= command (discarded in profit of =glances=
  python package)

  =emacs= default font
